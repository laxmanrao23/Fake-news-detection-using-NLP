In this modern era, everyone relies on various online resources for news. Since there are many social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter etc., news spread rapidly among millions of users. However, there may be some misleading content for damaging the reputation of people or firms. The fake news propagators intentionally spread fake news to affect public opinion on certain matters. So, to stop spreading this fake news and to rescue innocent people from fake news propagators, detection of fake news at an early stage is very essential. There are various techniques exists to detect fake news, among them natural language processing is one of the techniques which works effectively and efficiently. In natural language processing, text pre-processing techniques such as regular expression, tokenization and lemmatization is used before vectorization. Vectorization is vectorizing the data into N-gram vectors or sequence vectors using terms frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) or one-hot encoding respectively. N-grams concept is mainly used to enhance the proposed model. In order to observe the accuracy of the model, classification algorithms of machine learning can be used. Fake news detection aims to provide the user with the ability to classify the news as fake or real.
